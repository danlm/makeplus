Installing make+
----------------

Make+ is entirely self-hosting! But don't worry, it's easy to build and
install make+ even if you don't already have make+ installed. Follow the
steps below to build, install or make a package.

1. Quick installation for the impatient:

	MAKEPLUS_HOME=`pwd`; export MAKEPLUS_HOME
	PATH=$MAKEPLUS_HOME:$PATH
	./configure [--prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc]
	make+
	su
	make+ install
	exit
	unset MAKEPLUS_HOME

Step by step instructions follow:

2. Set the MAKEPLUS_HOME environment variable to point to the make+
   source files.

   Make sure you are in the unpacked make+ source directory and type:

	MAKEPLUS_HOME=`pwd`
	export MAKEPLUS_HOME

   If you are using CSH, type:

	setenv MAKEPLUS_HOME `pwd`

   Note that those are backquotes (`) around the pwd.

   To check this, type:

	echo $MAKEPLUS_HOME

   which should show the full path to the unpacked source directory.

   Similarly you also need to update your PATH so that the 'make+'
   program can be found:

	PATH=$MAKEPLUS_HOME:$PATH

3. Configure the paths used by make+. Normally you would do:

	./configure

   This will install make+ entirely under the /usr/local directory. To
   install under /usr and with the configuration file in /etc, do:

	./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

4. Run make+ to have it build itself:

	make+

5. To perform a straightforward install, you'll need to be root (but
   you don't need to be root yet if all you want to do is build an RPM).
   To become root, type:

	su

   you will probably be asked for the root password.

6. Type:

	make+ install
	exit

7. If you prefer, you can build an RPM of make+:

	make+ rpm

   The RPM will end up under build-*/makeplus-*.rpm

8. Remove the MAKEPLUS_HOME environment variable.

	unset MAKEPLUS_HOME
