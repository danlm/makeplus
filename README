Make+ is a set of scripts which enhance GNU make. The scripts replace
the functionality of autoconf, automake, rpm, dpkg and more, allowing
you to build, install, make RPMs, make Debian packages and more, all
from a single maintainable 'Makefile+' script.

To find out how to install make+, please read the accompanying INSTALL
file.
