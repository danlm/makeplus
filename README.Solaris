It is possible to install and use make+ on Solaris. Make sure, however,
that you have installed the GNU software from http://www.sunfreeware.com/,
in particular these packages:

make
fileutils
gzip
bash
grep

You may also need to ensure that the GNU versions of the tools are first
in the PATH, for example by doing:

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
